Some questions to consider:

Does your code build properly with "stack build"?
Yes

Are there any parts of the specification you did not implement in part
A?
No, not to the best of my knowledge

For the 'stretch' part B, which libraries did you use and what kind of
output did you generate?
For part B, I used haskell-chart, but was unable to get the cairo backend dependency working.
I instead used the Diagrams backend, which is largely a clone of cairo so far as I can tell. 
The output generated is an svg file containing a pie-chart of the professors in each department. 
After running Main.hs, this can be found in the top-level directory (/prof-scraper/output.svg)
